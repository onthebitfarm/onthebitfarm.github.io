            <p>
              <strong>Paparazzo</strong> is by Pablo, a son of
              the legendary champion stallion Pilot. Paparazzo
              was approved in 1997 and was purchased by the
              National Stud of Neustadt/Dosse. During his
              stallion performance test in 1998, he received
              highest scores for his Temperament, Character,
              Constitution and Willingness to Work from 9.0 to
              10. He scored for his jumping ability also between
              8.5 and 10. His talent for the jumper classes
              became obvious from the beginning. Next to his
              breeding duties he performed and earned numerous
              ribbons. Every year he fulfilled his expectations
              and finished his German show record with an
              outstanding performance during the CSI in
              Neustadt/Dosse in 2003, by winning a class in the
              so-called Youngster Tour (classes for up-coming
              Grand Prix horses).<br>
              Throughout 2007 the achievements of Paparazzo's
              offspring placed him at the top of USEF's Hunter
              Breeding Sire List, with a final national ranking
              in the top two!

              Pilot, out of Monie, by Matrox - Lancelot, finished
              his stallion performance test with an overall score
              of 136.22 (2/53). For dressage he received 138.21
              points (2/53) and for jumping he received 129.11
              (3/53). Pablo himself comes from a very successful
              family. His sire Pilot is considered to be one of
              the best jumper producers in the world. He sired
              many international Grand Prix horses including the
              Famous Grand Prix mare Pialotta.

              "77"><strong>Paparazzo's</strong> dam sire,
              Deb&uuml;tant, is an offspring of the Hanoverian
              D-line. He is by Damokles, who also is the dam sire
              of the stallion, "Rolls Royce". In Germany he
              produced ridable horses for both dressage and show
              jumping. Just a few months ago the approved
              stallion, Royal Silver, was sold in the US and
              placed already in the Hunter classes in Palm Beach
              this year. Deb&uuml;tant's dam sire, Adlerorden
              traces back to the thoroughbred stallion,
              Adlerschild XX, who is the dam sire of the 3 time
              European jumper champion Deister, ridden by Paul
              Schockem&ouml;hle. Adlerorden is also the sire in
              the third generation of the stallion Sandro Song,
              who sired the champion stallion Sandro Hit, the
              world champion of the 5-year old dressage horses
              1998.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Paparazzo's</strong> sire in the third
              generation, Raffael, comes also from a very good
              solid family line. He is a grandson of the
              legendary foundation sire Ramzes. His offspring are
              competing around the world in international Grand
              Prix dressage classes and the biggest Grand Prix
              jumper classes (Ratina Z, Lectron, Rampal and many
              others). Raffael's dam sire, Almf&uuml;hrer,
              contains in his pedigree two foundation sires of
              the very successful jumper breeding program, Feiner
              Kerl. Feiner Kerl sired Ferdinand, who produced
              several Olympic horses for the Olympic games in the
              1956, 1960 and 1968.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Paparazzo</strong> is an elegant stallion
              with fabulous hunter movement, "picture-perfect"
              jumping style and an exceptional disposition.
