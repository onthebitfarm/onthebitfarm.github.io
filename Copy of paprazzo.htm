			<p><strong>Paparazzo</strong> is by Pablo, a son of the legendary champion stallion Pilot. Paparazzo was approved in 1997 and was purchased by the National Stud of Neustadt/Dosse. During his stallion performance test in 1998, he received highest scores for his Temperament, Character, Constitution and Willingness to Work from 9.0 to 10. He scored for his jumping ability also between 8.5 and 10. His talent for the jumper classes became obvious from the beginning. Next to his breeding duties he performed and earned numerous ribbons. Every year he fulfilled his expectations and finished his German show record with an outstanding performance during the CSI in Neustadt/Dosse earlier this year by winning a class in the so-called Youngster Tour (classes for up-coming Grand Prix horses).</p>

For dressage he received 138.21 points (2/53) and for jumping he received 129.11 (3/53). Pablo himself comes from a very successful family. His sire Pilot is considered to be one of the best jumper producers in the world. He sired many international Grand Prix horses including the Famous Grand Prix mare Pialotta. Pablo sired more than 140 show horses, 20 of them are on their way into the &quot;big&quot; Grand Prix&quot; jumper ring and some into the Olympic dressage ring.</p>

He is by Damokles, who also is the dam sire of the stallion, &quot;Rolls Royce&quot;. In Germany he produced ridable horses for both dressage and show jumping. Just a few months ago the approved stallion, Royal Silver, was sold in the US and placed already in the Hunter classes in Palm Beach this year. Deb&uuml;tant's dam sire, Adlerorden traces back to the thoroughbred stallion, Adlerschild XX, who is the dam sire of the 3 time European jumper champion Deister, ridden by Paul Schockem&ouml;hle. Adlerorden is also the sire in the third generation of the stallion Sandro Song, who sired the champion stallion Sandro Hit, the world champion of the 5-year old dressage horses 1998.</p>
			<p><strong>Paparazzo's</strong> sire in the third generation, Raffael, comes also from a very good solid family line. He is a grandson of the legendary foundation sire Ramzes. His offspring are competing around the world in international Grand Prix dressage classes and the biggest Grand Prix jumper classes (Ratina Z, Lectron, Rampal and many others). Raffael's dam sire, Almf&uuml;hrer, contains in his pedigree two foundation sires of the very successful jumper breeding program, Feiner Kerl. Feiner Kerl sired Ferdinand, who produced several Olympic horses for the Olympic games in the 1956, 1960 and 1968.</p>
			<p><strong>Paparazzo </strong> is an elegant stallion with fabulous hunter movement, &quot;picture-perfect&quot; jumping style and an exceptional disposition.</p>
